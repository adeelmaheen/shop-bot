2. Integrating the Chatbot UI on Your Shopify Store
To add this chatbot widget to your Shopify store, follow these steps:

Step 1: Upload the chatbot-widget.js to Shopify
Go to your Shopify Admin:

In your Shopify admin panel, go to Online Store > Themes.

Upload chatbot-widget.js to the assets folder:

In the theme editor, click on Actions > Edit code.

Go to the Assets folder, then click on Add a new asset.

Upload your chatbot-widget.js file here.

Step 2: Create the Shopify Liquid Template
Create a new file in your Shopify theme called gemini_integration.liquid (or any name you prefer), and add the following code:

<script src="{{ 'chatbot-widget.js' | asset_url }}"></script>


Step 3: Add the Liquid Template to Your Theme Layout
Now, include this template in your Shopify theme to ensure it loads the chatbot on the page. For example, you can add this to your theme.liquid layout file (or a specific template where you want the chatbot):

Go to the theme.liquid file (or the template you want to add the chatbot to).

Just before the closing </body> tag, include the following:


{% include 'gemini_integration' %}
This ensures the chatbot widget is loaded on the page.
